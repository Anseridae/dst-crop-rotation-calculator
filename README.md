# dst-crop-rotation-calculator

a simple crop rotation calculator that I made in a single afternoon with the help of the information on the wiki: https://dontstarve.wiki.gg/wiki/Farm_Plant

features include automatic swapping of crop icons for different seasons to show which crops are in/out of season:

an info panel to show the stats of different nutrient sources as well as a legend/header at the top of the info panel. and a counter at the top to show the consumption/production of different nutrients by the crops in the farm plot:
